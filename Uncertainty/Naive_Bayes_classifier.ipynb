    "Experiment with removing frequent words (called stop words) and very infrequent words so you end up with a reasonable number of words used in the classifier. Maybe you need to remove digits or all non-letter characters. You may also use a stemming algorithm.\n",

    "Use 80% of the data (called training set; randomly chosen) to learn the parameters of the naive Bayes classifier (prior probabilities and likelihoods). Use Laplacian smoothing for the counts.\n",
